# Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformer - Prediction Sequence Changes

## Summary

Successfully modified the Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformer to change the prediction sequence from **"forward state → goal_latent → backward state"** to **"goal_latent → backward state → forward state"** to enable soft conditioning on goal paths.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Prediction Sequence Order

**Before:**
```
[initial_image, initial_state] → forward_states → goal_image → backward_states
```

**After:**
```
[initial_image, initial_state] → goal_image → backward_states → forward_states
```

### 2. Modified Autoregressive Training Sequence

#### File: `bidirectional_autoregressive_transformer.py`
- **Function:** `_forward_training()`
- **Change:** Reordered the autoregressive token sequence to place goal prediction first, followed by backward states, then forward states
- **Benefit:** Creates proper temporal conditioning where later predictions can attend to earlier ones

### 3. Updated Query-Based Inference Sequence  

#### File: `bidirectional_autoregressive_transformer.py`
- **Function:** `_forward_inference()`
- **Change:** Reordered query tokens to match new prediction sequence: `[goal_query, backward_query, forward_query]`
- **Benefit:** Enables non-autoregressive inference with proper conditioning hierarchy

### 4. Enhanced Attention Masking for Soft Conditioning

#### File: `bidirectional_autoregressive_transformer.py`
- **Function:** `_create_query_based_mask()`
- **Change:** Implemented cascading attention pattern:
  - Goal query → attends to conditioning tokens only
  - Backward query → attends to conditioning tokens + goal query
  - Forward query → attends to conditioning tokens + goal query + backward query
- **Benefit:** Creates soft conditioning where each prediction stage can utilize information from previous stages

### 5. Updated Documentation and Comments

- Modified class docstrings to reflect new prediction order
- Updated pipeline descriptions to emphasize goal-conditioned generation
- Added comments explaining the soft conditioning mechanism

## Technical Details

### Attention Pattern
```python
# Attention mask (False = allowed, True = masked)
# Sequence: [init_img, init_state, goal_query, backward_query, forward_query]
[[False, True,  True,  True,  True ],   # init_img
 [False, False, True,  True,  True ],   # init_state  
 [False, False, True,  True,  True ],   # goal_query
 [False, False, False, True,  True ],   # backward_query
 [False, False, False, False, True ]]   # forward_query
```

### Token Type Embeddings
- `0`: Image tokens (initial and goal images)
- `1`: State tokens (initial, forward, and backward states)
- `2`: Goal image token (in autoregressive sequence)
- `3`: Forward query token
- `4`: Goal query token  
- `5`: Backward query token

### Sequence Positions (New Order)
1. **Conditioning Tokens** (positions 0-1): `[initial_image, initial_state]`
2. **Goal Prediction** (position 2): Goal image latent generation
3. **Backward Prediction** (position 3): Backward trajectory conditioned on goal
4. **Forward Prediction** (position 4): Forward trajectory conditioned on goal + backward path

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Soft Goal Conditioning**: The model now generates a goal first, which conditions all subsequent predictions
2. **Cascading Information Flow**: Later predictions can attend to and benefit from earlier predictions
3. **Improved Path Planning**: Forward trajectory generation is informed by both the goal and the backward path
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: Both autoregressive training and non-autoregressive inference work with the new sequence

## Verification Results

✅ **Training Mode**: Successfully generates predictions in new order with proper loss computation  
✅ **Inference Mode**: Non-autoregressive generation works with cascading attention  
✅ **Gradient Flow**: Training loop converges with decreasing losses  
✅ **Attention Pattern**: Soft conditioning mechanism verified through attention mask analysis  
✅ **DiffusionRgbEncoder**: Integration maintained (tested separately)  

## Usage

The modified model can be used exactly as before - all existing training scripts and interfaces remain compatible. The new prediction sequence is handled internally by the model architecture.

```python
# Training (unchanged interface)
predictions = model(
    initial_images=initial_images,
    initial_states=initial_states, 
    forward_states=forward_states,
    goal_images=goal_images,
    backward_states=backward_states,
    training=True
)

# Inference (unchanged interface)
results = model(
    initial_images=initial_images,
    initial_states=initial_states,
    training=False
)
```

*This architecture change enables the Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformer to be softly conditioned on goal paths, potentially improving trajectory generation quality through better goal-aware planning.*
