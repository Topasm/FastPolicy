# Placeholder for LLaMA-style transformer core
# This file is optional. You can use nn.TransformerDecoder directly as shown
# in diffusion_policy.py for simplicity.

# If you need a specific LLaMA-like architecture (e.g., with RMSNorm, SwiGLU FFN),
# you would implement it here.

# Example structure (highly simplified):
# import torch
# import torch.nn as nn
#
# class LLaMABlock(nn.Module):
#     def __init__(self, dim, n_heads, multiple_of=256):
#         super().__init__()
#         # Implementation of Attention (e.g., with RoPE)
#         # Implementation of FeedForward (e.g., SwiGLU)
#         # Implementation of RMSNorm
#         pass
#
#     def forward(self, x, mask=None, cache=None):
#         # Forward pass through Attention and FeedForward with norms
#         pass
#
# class LLaMACore(nn.Module):
#     def __init__(self, vocab_size, dim, n_layers, n_heads, multiple_of=256):
#         super().__init__()
#         # Embedding layer
#         # Stack of LLaMABlocks
#         # Final normalization
#         # Output projection (e.g., to vocab)
#         pass
#
#     def forward(self, tokens, targets=None):
#         # Full forward pass
#         pass
